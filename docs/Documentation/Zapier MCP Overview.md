# Zapier MCP Overview

## What is Zapier MCP?
Zapier MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI assistants to directly access over 7,000+ apps and 30,000+ actions without complex API integrations. It enables AI to perform real tasks like sending messages, managing data, scheduling events, and updating records, transforming it from a conversational tool to a functional extension of applications.

## Key Benefits:
*   **Expand AI capabilities:** Connects AI to real-world actions across Zapier's app ecosystem.
*   **Automate at scale:** Deploy AI-powered actions across essential business tools like Slack, Google Workspace, HubSpot, and thousands more without building custom integrations.
*   **Secure and Reliable:** Zapier handles authentication, API limits, and security for all integrations.

## How it works (from a high level):
Zapier MCP acts as a bridge between an AI assistant and various applications. The AI assistant sends commands or requests to Zapier MCP, which then translates these into actions within the connected apps. This eliminates the need for the AI to directly integrate with each individual app's API.

## Relationship to Slash / MCP:
Based on the MCP Hub repository analysis, the MCP Hub frontend explicitly lists Zapier as an integration. This suggests that the Slash / MCP project aims to leverage Zapier MCP to extend its own capabilities, allowing its AI ChatBar and command routing to interact with the vast ecosystem of applications supported by Zapier. The Slash / MCP server would likely act as an "MCP client" in the Zapier MCP ecosystem, sending commands to Zapier MCP for execution.
