Rebranding Information:

New Brand Name: MCP Messenger (inferred from file names)
New Logo: mcpmessenger_logo_static.png (attached by user)

Further details regarding brand guidelines (e.g., color palette, typography, tone of voice) are expected to be in the `mcpmessenger_brand_guidelines.pdf` file. As I cannot directly read PDF content, I will proceed with the assumption that the core rebrand involves the name change to 'MCP Messenger' and the new logo. If more detailed brand guidelines are required for the plan, the user will need to provide the text content from the PDF.
