# Product Requirements Document: MCP Hub Connector Implementation (Frontend Team)

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements for the frontend team to implement new Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors within the MCP Hub platform. The goal is to expand the platform's integration capabilities, enhance workflow automation, and provide users with seamless connectivity to a wider range of essential business and development tools.

## 2. Connector Prioritization and Rationale

### 2.1. Zapier and Make.com (Automation Platforms)

**Description:** Both Zapier and Make.com are leading no-code/low-code automation platforms that enable users to connect various web applications and automate workflows. MCP Hub already has explicit support and documentation for these platforms, indicating existing foundational work.

**Rationale:**

> "High leverage due to extensive third-party integrations, existing foundational support, and a clear path to showcase MCP's value as an automation hub. This can be highly motivating for teams as they see their work enable a vast ecosystem."

Integrating deeply with Zapier and Make.com will significantly extend the reach of MCP Hub, allowing users to orchestrate complex workflows involving thousands of applications. This demonstrates MCP Hub's power as a central orchestration layer and provides immense value to users seeking comprehensive automation solutions.

**Frontend Requirements:**

*   **UI for Credential Management:** Enhance or create dedicated UI components within the Integrations Gallery for Zapier and Make.com. This includes fields for Base URL and optional API Key, consistent with existing credential management patterns.
*   **Provider Portal:** Develop or update provider portals for Zapier and Make.com, allowing users to manage connections, view supported commands, and potentially trigger workflows directly from the MCP Hub interface.
*   **Command Integration:** Ensure that commands exposed by Zapier and Make.com (e.g., `list zaps`, `trigger zap`) are discoverable and executable via the ChatBar and command dropdowns.
*   **User Feedback:** Implement clear status indicators and error messages for connection status, command execution, and workflow outcomes.

### 2.2. n8n (Open-Source Automation Platform)

**Description:** n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform, offering a powerful alternative to commercial solutions like Zapier and Make.com. The `mcpserver` already includes an n8n custom node, providing a strong foundation for integration.

**Rationale:**

> "Aligns with open-source philosophy, provides an alternative to commercial automation platforms, and can foster community engagement."

Supporting n8n aligns with MCP Hub's focus on 


open and free tools, and can appeal to a segment of users who prefer self-hosted or open-source solutions.

**Frontend Requirements:**

*   **UI for Credential Management:** Similar to Zapier and Make.com, create UI components for n8n within the Integrations Gallery for managing Base URL and API Key.
*   **Provider Portal:** Develop an n8n provider portal for managing connections and discovering commands.
*   **Command Integration:** Ensure n8n commands are discoverable and executable via the ChatBar and command dropdowns.
*   **User Feedback:** Implement clear status indicators and error messages for n8n integrations.

### 2.3. Notion, Slack, Jira (Roadmap Items)

**Description:** Notion, Slack, and Jira are widely used business tools for collaboration, communication, and project management. Integrating with these platforms will significantly expand the utility of MCP Hub for enterprise users.

**Rationale:**

> "High demand in business environments, expands the platform's use cases, and presents interesting technical challenges that can keep the team engaged."

Integrating with these tools will demonstrate MCP Hub's ability to integrate with enterprise-level tools, addressing a high demand in business environments and presenting engaging technical challenges for the team.

**Frontend Requirements:**

*   **UI for Credential Management:** Create UI components for Notion, Slack, and Jira within the Integrations Gallery for managing authentication (e.g., OAuth flows, API tokens).
*   **Provider Portals:** Develop dedicated provider portals for each, allowing users to manage connections and discover commands relevant to each platform (e.g., listing Slack channels, creating Jira issues, managing Notion pages).
*   **Command Integration:** Ensure commands for Notion, Slack, and Jira are discoverable and executable via the ChatBar and command dropdowns.
*   **User Feedback:** Implement clear status indicators and error messages for these integrations.

## 3. General Frontend Considerations

*   **Reusability:** Utilize existing UI components (e.g., `ProviderPortalModal`, `IntegrationsGallery`) and patterns for new connector UIs to maintain consistency and accelerate development.
*   **State Management:** Adhere to the existing state management patterns (e.g., React hooks, context providers) for handling connector-specific data.
*   **User Experience (UX):** Ensure new connector UIs are intuitive, responsive, and consistent with the overall design language of MCP Hub.
*   **API Service Integration:** Use `mcpApiService.ts` for all communication with the MCP Server to ensure consistent API call patterns and header management.
*   **Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new frontend components related to these connectors.
