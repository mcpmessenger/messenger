# Frontend Team Manual: Integrating Lovable-Built Applications with MCP

**Date: June 20, 2025**

## Subject: Integration of Lovable-Built Web Applications with MCP Frontend

This manual outlines the strategy for integrating web applications built using Lovable into the MCP frontend. It's crucial to understand that Lovable is primarily a platform for generating and deploying web applications, not a library or API to be directly embedded into our existing frontend codebase. Therefore, the integration will focus on how our MCP frontend can interact with *external* web applications that have been created and deployed via Lovable.

### 1. Understanding the Role of Lovable

Lovable allows us to rapidly create and deploy various web applications (e.g., landing pages, dashboards, forms). These applications will exist as standalone entities with their own URLs. The MCP backend will be responsible for orchestrating the creation and deployment of these Lovable-built applications.

### 2. Frontend Interaction with Lovable-Built Applications

Since Lovable-built applications are external, the MCP frontend will interact with them primarily through standard web mechanisms:

*   **Embedding (iFrame):** For simple display or interaction, Lovable-built applications can be embedded within the MCP frontend using an `<iframe>`. This is suitable for displaying dashboards, forms, or static content generated by Lovable.

    ```html
    <iframe src="[URL_OF_LOVABLE_APP]" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    ```

    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **Styling:** Ensure the embedded application's styling is consistent or at least not jarring with the MCP frontend's design.
        *   **Responsiveness:** Verify that the Lovable-built application is responsive and displays correctly within the `<iframe>` on various screen sizes.
        *   **Security (Sandbox):** Use the `sandbox` attribute on the `<iframe>` for enhanced security if the embedded content is from an untrusted source or if you want to restrict its capabilities (e.g., `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"`).

*   **Direct Navigation:** For more complex interactions or full-page experiences, the MCP frontend can provide links or buttons that navigate users directly to the Lovable-built application's URL.

    ```html
    <a href="[URL_OF_LOVABLE_APP]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Lovable Application</a>
    ```

*   **API Interaction (if Lovable-built app has an API):** If a Lovable-built application itself exposes an API (e.g., a form submission API, a data retrieval API), the MCP frontend can make direct API calls to that application. This would be handled like any other external API integration.

    *   **Example (Conceptual - assuming Lovable-built app exposes a REST API):**

        ```javascript
        // Example using fetch API in a React component or similar
        fetch('[URL_OF_LOVABLE_APP]/api/data')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
                // Process data from Lovable-built app
                console.log(data);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error('Error fetching data from Lovable app:', error);
            });
        ```

        *   **CORS:** Be mindful of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. The Lovable-built application's server must be configured to allow requests from the MCP frontend's origin.
        *   **Authentication:** If the Lovable-built application requires authentication, the MCP frontend will need to handle passing credentials or tokens securely.

### 3. Data Flow and Communication

*   **Frontend to Lovable-Built App:** Data can be passed to Lovable-built applications via URL parameters (for simple cases) or through their exposed APIs.
*   **Lovable-Built App to Frontend/Backend:** For data to flow back from a Lovable-built application to the MCP system, the Lovable-built application itself must be configured to send data. This could involve:
    *   **Webhooks:** The Lovable-built application could be configured to send webhooks to an MCP backend endpoint upon certain events (e.g., form submission).
    *   **Direct API Calls:** The Lovable-built application could make direct API calls to the MCP backend.

### 4. Coordination with Backend Team

Crucially, the MCP frontend will rely on the MCP backend to:

*   **Provide URLs:** The backend will need to provide the dynamic URLs of the deployed Lovable-built applications.
*   **Orchestrate Deployment:** The backend will handle the process of instructing Lovable to build and deploy applications (potentially via browser automation or other indirect means).
*   **Handle Inbound Data:** The backend will be responsible for receiving data (e.g., webhooks) from Lovable-built applications and integrating it into the MCP system.

### 5. Future Considerations for Chaining Commands

Once the backend establishes a reliable way to orchestrate Lovable, the frontend can expose new commands or UI elements that trigger these chained workflows. For example, a 


button in the MCP frontend could initiate a backend command like "create_landing_page_for_product_X" which then triggers the Lovable deployment process and returns the URL to the frontend for display or embedding.

### Action Items for Frontend Team:

*   Familiarize yourselves with the concept of embedding external web content (iframes) and cross-origin communication.
*   Coordinate closely with the Backend Team to understand how Lovable-built application URLs will be provided and how data will flow.
*   Design UI elements that can effectively display or link to Lovable-built applications.
*   Be prepared to handle potential CORS issues and authentication challenges when interacting with Lovable-built application APIs.
